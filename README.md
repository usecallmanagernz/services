## Requirements

The following non-standard Python modules are required: `requests` and `Flask`.

You can use the packages provided by your OS distribution or run
`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to satisfy those dependancies.

## Installation

The following commands are for Apache on Ubuntu, you may need to adjust some
them for a different distributions.

Copy files and create a virtual-host for services via HTTP:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/services
sudo cp *.py *.wsgi /var/www/services
sudo cp virtualhost.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/xml-services
sudo a2ensite xml-services
```

Optionally, to enable secure services virtual-host via HTTPS.

```
sudo cp virtualhost-ssl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/secure-xml-services
sudo a2ensite secure-xml-services
```

Restart apache.

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

See [HTTP Provisioning](https://usecallmanager.nz/apache-conf.html#XML-Services)
for more information.

The Asterisk Manager web interface also needs to be enabled in
`/etc/asterisk/manager.conf` and a user added with the credentials from `config.yml`.

```
[general]
...
enabled=yes
webenabled=yes

[asterisk]
secret=asterisk
read=all
...
```

Create a directory to store quality and problem report logs. A different path
may be specified in `config.yml`.

```
mkdir /var/log/cisco
chown www-data:www-data /var/log/cisco
```
